## Changes
>Using the Semantic HTML Elements

```<div>``` were replaced with corresponding elements such as ```<header>,<nav>,<section>,<article>,<aside>,<footer>```

>Fix the non-working Hyperlink ```Search Engine Optimization```

Because ID was missing from the HTML code, Hyperlink ```Search Engine Optimization``` did not work, so I had to write an ID in it.
